# Acte de Pr√©sence ‚Äì Admin Interface Development Plan

This document outlines the development plan for the Admin Interface, incorporating existing functionality while aligning with our new microservice architecture.

## üéØ Overview

The Admin Interface will be a modern, responsive web application built with Next.js, serving as the primary management interface for the Acte de Pr√©sence platform. It will communicate with our microservices through a dedicated API Gateway.
